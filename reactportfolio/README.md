## Description

To create a simple portfolio page with React. This portfolio will contain my contact information, CV, gitHub link and LinkedIn link. It will contain multiple pages which will use the React Router to naviageet across. It will use Bootstrap v5.3 to style the components, but will be personalised with further styling from the CSS folder. This project will consolidate much of the learning from the rest of program. The aim will be to make the final deployed page as professional looking as possible. This will be an ongoing project, as I shall be updating it as I work on more projects and gain more skills.
